* Interact with node Console (node)
* Run a file with node (node <filename>)
    - same can be done with ruby (ruby <filename.rb>)

* Running a program
    - add the program and function arguments within (code... echo("string", number))
    - program will not run if the function is called on its own

* Returning a value != printing a value
